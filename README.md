# Rust ðŸ¦€ SSA Compiler WIP

A compiler that uses SSA (single static assignment form) as its definitive IR written entirely in Rust!

The compiler hosts an optimization pipeline and native assembly generation.

## Usage

Supply the binary with command-line arguments:

Display Options:
```sh
$ cargo run -- --help
```

Compile `correct3.lang` into RISCV assembly:
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cargo run -- examples/correct3.lang -o build
```

Disable optimization:
```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cargo run -- examples/correct3.lang -o build --no-optimize
```
